  <p>
   Welcome to the Soft Matter Group! We explore the fascinating world of soft matter physics through both 
   theoretical and computational approaches. We use the concepts of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to 
   understand the mechanics properties of soft matter.
  </p>
  <p>
   I am a theoretical physicist with extensive expertise in soft matter physics, specializing in the dynamics and 
   mechanical properties of glassy systems, granular materials, random elastic networks, and strongly coupled liquids. 
   My work is grounded in advanced theoretical modeling and computational simulations, backed by a deep understanding of 
   statistical physics. I am dedicated to advancing the study of disordered solids, prioritizing quality research that 
   addresses key questions in the field. Beyond my research, I am passionate about education and science outreach, 
   working to make complex scientific ideas accessible to both experts and the broader public. Collaboration and 
   mentorship are central to my approach, and I take pride in guiding graduate students with thoughtful and supportive 
   supervision. In addition to physics, I actively volunteer, and I am multilingual, fluent in Marwadi, Hindi, English, 
   and Bengali. My personal interests extend to philosophy, psychology, art, history, and world cuisines, all of which 
   enrich my professional and personal life.

<!-- Research Areas-->
 <div class="content" id="research">
 <h2>Research Areas</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Statistical Physics</li>
<p>
     Equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics are two central and interrelated branches of physics that
     deal with the behavior of systems with many interacting particles. Equilibrium statistical mechanics, based on the
     laws of thermodynamics, deals with systems that are in a state of thermal balance, meaning that the macroscopic
     variables such as temperature, pressure and energy are constant in time or fluctuate around their mean values. On 
     the other hand, Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics focuses on the behavior of systems that are not in a state of 
     thermal balance, where the macroscopic variables are changing over time. We focus mainly of non-equilibrium 
     statistical mechanics taking the systems mentioned below as a subject of research. We primary try to understand the 
     mechanical properties of disordered athermal solids such as glass transition,  jamming, onset of rigidity, 
     vibrational modes to mention a few. We also try to study pattern formations and fluid instabilities in non-Newtonian
     fluids, one such example is dusty plasma also known as Yukawa fluids.   
</p>

<li>Granular Materials</li>
<p>
    Granular materials are composed of discrete, macroscopic particles that primarily interact through contact forces, 
    rather than long-range forces. Unlike systems governed by thermal fluctuations, granular 
    materials are athermal and dissipative. They lose energy through friction and inelastic collisions, leading to unique 
    mechanical properties. This non-equilibrium 
    behaviour becomes even more intricate when considering nonspherical particles, such as ellipsoids, which exhibit restricted 
    rotational motion and more complex contact geometries compared to spherical particles (see <a href="#ElipseGranular">Fig. 1</a>).
    Non-spherical particles have anisotropic contact geometries, which influence the transmission of forces through the material 
    and lead to varied stress distributions and force chain structures. The mechanical stability and force chains in such systems 
    depend not only on the packing fraction but also on particle shape, orientation, and contact mechanics, leading to complex 
    force networks that require detailed analysis. Jamming, which refers to the transition from a fluid-like state to a rigid, 
    mechanically stable state, is well-studied in spherical particles, but the jamming behaviour of non-spherical particles remains 
    less explored. While prior studies have explored some aspects of ellipsoidal granular materials, the role of friction in such systems remains 
    insufficiently addressed, mainly due to the complexities of modeling friction in non-spherical geometries. In this group, 
    we try fill this gap.

</figure>
</div>

<li>Active matter</li>
<p>
Active matter, an emerging field of research in soft matter physics, is a prime example of a non-equilibrium system.
This field focuses on the behavior of systems composed of self-driven particles that are able to convert energy into
motion. The study of active matter includes a wide range of systems, such as swimming microorganisms, synthetic
active colloids, and active gels. In these systems, the interactions between the particles and the conversion of energy
into motion lead to the emergence of complex and often self-organized behavior, such as pattern formation and collective 
motion.
</p>

<li>Complex Plasma (Dusty Plasma)</li>
<p>
  Yukawa liquids (YLs), a type of complex plasma, form when micron-sized dust grains are immersed in an electron-ion plasma, 
  resulting in a strongly coupled system due to the dust grains acquiring high charges 
  (&asymp; <span class="highlight">10<sup>4</sup>e</span>). In such systems, the dust grains interact through a screened 
  Coulomb potential, also known as Yukawa interaction, where the background plasma provides shielding. The small 
  charge-to-mass ratio (&lt; 1), high average potential-to-kinetic energy ratio (&gt; 50) and low temperature 
  (&asymp; 0.025 eV) lead to the dominance of potential energy over kinetic energy, causing the system to 
  behave in a strongly coupled regime. Depending on the coupling strength, YLs can exist in various states 
  (solid-like, liquid-like, or gas-like), and the liquid phase, in particular, offers a 
  unique opportunity to explore non-equilibrium phenomena and spatiotemporal pattern formation. Due to 
  their mechanical properties, YLs are often described as the <span class="highlight">plasma state of soft matter</span> 
  exhibiting viscoelastic behavior. This makes them an ideal system to study the  
  effect of long-range interactions and coupling strength on turbulence, and instabilities under 
  non-equilibrium conditions.
</p>

<li>Random Elastic Networks</li>
<p>
  Random Elastic Networks (RENs) are constructed by considering a set of nodes (representing particles, atoms, or 
  molecules) connected by springs or elastic bonds, forming an irregular network with random connectivity, Z 
  (see <a href="#ElastNet1">Fig. 2</a>) and exhibit dynamic heterogeneity when sheared 
  (see <a href="#ElastNet2">Fig. 3</a>). These networks are particularly useful for modeling materials that lack regular 
  crystalline structures but still exhibit elastic properties when subjected to external forces. The study of RENs 
  provides insights into how local interactions between components (e.g., inter-particle 
  forces or molecular bonds) give rise to macroscopic mechanical properties like elasticity, rigidity, and deformation.

<li>Biological physics</li>
<p>
Biological physics, a multidisciplinary field that combines the principles of physics and biology, is another area of
research in soft matter physics. In biological physics, the focus is on understanding the behavior and function of
biological systems, such as cells, tissues, and organisms, at the molecular, cellular, and organismal level. The study
of biological physics is important for a wide range of applications, including the development of new therapies and
treatments for diseases, the design of new materials based on biological principles, and the understanding of evolution
and adaptation.
